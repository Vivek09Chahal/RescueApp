# Rescue App
This app is the part of my project in which we are making a rescue system which will send the emergency location and all the details about the user after receiving emergency alert of our hardware prototype that will be fitted in vehicles.
* We are taking the use information such as
1. Name
2. Age
3. Blood group 
4. Address 

* User can set the emergency contact itself will be listed from his contact book.

* And we are also getting live location from our hardware prototype and send it with with emergency message.
Which will work on messaging that mean there is no need of the internet for this app to send emergency.
